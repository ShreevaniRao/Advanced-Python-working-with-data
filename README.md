# Advanced Python: Working With Data
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Advanced Python: Working With Data. 

In this course, I worked with datasets in Python, highlighting some of the most useful built-in features of the language. Using a real data set from the United States Geological Survey that tracks earthquake information, I performed data operations like sorting and filtering, determining basic information like minimum and maximum values, and reading and writing data to and from other formats like CSV and JSON, demonstrating how Python can help you make sense of your data.
