# Programming challenge: summarize the earthquake data

import json


# for this challenge, we're going to summarize the earthquake data as follows:
# 1: How many quakes are there in total?
# 2: How many quakes were felt by at least 100 people?
# 3: Print the name of the place whose quake was felt by the most people, with the # of reports
# 4: Print the top 10 most significant events, with the significance value of each

# open the data file and load the JSON
with open("./30DayQuakes.json", "r") as datafile:
    data = json.load(datafile)

    print(len(data["features"]))

    print(sum(quake["properties"]["felt"] is not None and quake["properties"]["felt"] >= 100 for quake in data["features"]))

        return False
    
    quakeFeltbyMost = max(data["features"], key=quakeFelt)
    print(quakeFeltbyMost["properties"]["title"])
    print(quakeFeltbyMost["properties"]["felt"])
